\subsection{Detailed Description}
Cross-\/platform, object-\/oriented thread. 

An class that is required to run actions in a parallel thread can be derived from \doxyref{Dsp\-Thread}{p.}{class_dsp_thread} in order to inherit multi-\/threading abilities. The Start() method initiates a parallel thread and executes the private virtual \-\_\-\-Run() method in that thread. The derived class must override this \-\_\-\-Run() method with one that executes the required parallel actions. Other threads may use the static Ms\-Sleep() and Set\-Priority() methods without having to derive from, or create an instance of \doxyref{Dsp\-Thread}{p.}{class_dsp_thread}. Priority for the created thread, or calling threads (via Set\-Priority()), may be selected from the public enumeration\-: Priority. 

The documentation for this class was generated from the following file\-:\begin{DoxyCompactItemize}
