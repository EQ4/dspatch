\subsection{Detailed Description}
Connection between two components. 

Dsp\-Components process and transfer data between each other in the form of signals via interconnecting \char`\"{}wires\char`\"{}. Each wire contains references to the linked component, the source output signal, and the destination input signal. The \doxyref{Dsp\-Wire}{p.}{struct_dsp_wire} struct simply stores these references for use in retrieving and providing signals across component connections. 

The documentation for this struct was generated from the following file\-:\begin{DoxyCompactItemize}

Dsp\-Wire.\-h\end{DoxyCompactItemize}
