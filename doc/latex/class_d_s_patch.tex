\subsection{Detailed Description}
System-\/wide \doxyref{D\-S\-Patch}{p.}{class_d_s_patch} functionality. 

At the core of the \doxyref{D\-S\-Patch}{p.}{class_d_s_patch} framework is what's known as the \char`\"{}global circuit\char`\"{}. The \doxyref{D\-S\-Patch}{p.}{class_d_s_patch} class and hence, the global circuit provides a transparent workspace for \char`\"{}global scoped components\char`\"{} (components not within a \doxyref{Dsp\-Circuit}{p.}{class_dsp_circuit}) to benefit from circuit parallel processing. As it is not required that components be explicitly added to a \doxyref{Dsp\-Circuit}{p.}{class_dsp_circuit} in order to be routed etc., in order for these global scoped components to benefit from the multi threading associated with the circuit scheduler, they are automatically added to the \doxyref{D\-S\-Patch}{p.}{class_d_s_patch} global circuit when parallel processing is required (i.\-e. Start\-Auto\-Tick() is called). Although global circuit operations are automatic and transparent to the user, if required, the user is may set the number of threads used by the global circuit by calling Set\-Global\-Thread\-Count().

Lastly, the Finalize() method must be called on application exit in order for \doxyref{D\-S\-Patch}{p.}{class_d_s_patch} to perform the necessary memory cleanup. 

The documentation for this class was generated from the following files\-:\begin{DoxyCompactItemize}
