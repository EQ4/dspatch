\subsection{Detailed Description}
Cross-\/platform, object-\/oriented mutex. 

\doxyref{Dsp\-Mutex}{p.}{class_dsp_mutex} is a simple mutex that can lock a critical section of code for exclusive access by the calling thread. Other threads attempting to acquire a lock while another has acquired it will wait at the Lock() method call until the thread that owns the mutex calls Unlock(). 

The documentation for this class was generated from the following file\-:\begin{DoxyCompactItemize}
