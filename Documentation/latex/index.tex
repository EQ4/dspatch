\section{Introduction}\label{index_intro_sec}
D\-S\-Patch, pronounced \char`\"{}dispatch\char`\"{}, is a powerful C++ flow-\/based programming library that allows you to create and route (or \char`\"{}patch\char`\"{}) high performance signal processing circuits. D\-S\-Patch is not limited to any particular type of circuit or signal, its generic object-\/oriented A\-P\-I allows you to create almost any process chain imaginable, from simple logic circuits to full-\/blown electronics simulation. D\-S\-Patch's simple framework makes development quick and easy, allowing you to hit the ground running on every project.

The two most important classes to consider are \doxyref{Dsp\-Component}{p.}{class_dsp_component} and \doxyref{Dsp\-Circuit}{p.}{class_dsp_circuit}. In order to route data to and from Dsp\-Components they can either be added to an \doxyref{Dsp\-Circuit}{p.}{class_dsp_circuit}, where they can be wired together (recommended), or they can be wired directly via public \doxyref{Dsp\-Component}{p.}{class_dsp_component} methods. The D\-S\-Patch engine takes care of all data transfer between interconnected components, when data is ready for a component to process, a callback\-: \char`\"{}\-Process\-\_\-()\char`\"{} is executed in that component. For a component to form part of the D\-S\-Patch framework, designers simply have to derive their component from the \doxyref{Dsp\-Component}{p.}{class_dsp_component} base class, configure the component I\-O in the component constructor, and implement the virtual Process\-\_\-() callback method.

\section{Getting Started}\label{index_install_sec}
\subsection{Step 1\-: Download D\-S\-Patch}\label{index_step1}
The D\-S\-Patch library can be downloaded from the {\tt {\bfseries Source\-Forge project page}}. Download the project archive and extract the contents anywhere you like.\subsection{Step 2\-: Check out the Dsp\-Demo project}\label{index_step2}
In the \char`\"{}\-Dsp\-Demo\char`\"{} folder (found in the D\-S\-Patch root directory) you will find a simple example project that uses the D\-S\-Patch library. This project has been written to assist developers in understanding the D\-S\-Patch A\-P\-I as well as to demonstrate how it could be used to build a real-\/time audio process chain. The quickest way to get this project compiled and running is to simply open the \char`\"{}\-D\-S\-Patch.\-sln\char`\"{} (Windows) or \char`\"{}\-D\-S\-Patch.\-xcodeproj\char`\"{} (Mac O\-S X) file (found in the root, and \char`\"{}\-Mac O\-S X$\backslash$\-D\-S\-Patch\char`\"{} directories respectively) depending on the platform used -\/\-This solution contains both the D\-S\-Patch library and Dsp\-Demo project side-\/by-\/side as would be typical in developing a D\-S\-Patch application.\subsection{Step 3\-: Create your own project}\label{index_step3}
To get started all you need to do from your project is \#include \char`\"{}\-D\-S\-Patch.\-h\char`\"{} from the \char`\"{}\-Include\char`\"{} folder (found in the \char`\"{}\-D\-S\-Patch\char`\"{} folder), and link to the D\-S\-Patch library (either by including all D\-S\-Patch source or by linking to a compiled library file). To speed things up you may want to copy, rename, and edit the Dsp\-Demo project from step 2 to get up and running faster.\subsection{Step 4\-: Make your own Dsp\-Components}\label{index_step4}
In the \char`\"{}\-Dsp\-Demo$\backslash$\-Source\char`\"{} folder (found in the \char`\"{}\-Dsp\-Demo\char`\"{} folder) you will find 2 source files\-: \char`\"{}\-Dsp\-Gain.\-h\char`\"{} and \char`\"{}\-Dsp\-Gain.\-cpp\char`\"{}. These files make up a very simple \doxyref{Dsp\-Component}{p.}{class_dsp_component} that adjusts the gain of the audio data passing through it. Much like the example project, the a fast way to create your own \doxyref{Dsp\-Component}{p.}{class_dsp_component} could be to copy these files to another destination, rename them, and edit the contents to satisfy your component's required behavior.\subsection{Step 5\-: Refer to the documentation}\label{index_step5}
Between the Dsp\-Demo project, the Dsp\-Gain component template and the documentation found here, you should have enough resources to get started with D\-S\-Patch straight away. If you have any questions or wish to report a bug, feel free to email me at {\tt marcus@adaptaudio.\-com}.
