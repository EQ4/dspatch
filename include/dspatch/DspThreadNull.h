/// Cross-platform, object-oriented thread

/**
An class that is required to run actions in a parallel thread can be derived from DspThread in
order to inherit multi-threading abilities. The Start() method initiates a parallel thread and
executes the private virtual _Run() method in that thread. The derived class must override this
_Run() method with one that executes the required parallel actions. Other threads may use the
static MsSleep() and SetPriority() methods without having to derive from, or create an instance of
DspThread. Priority for the created thread, or calling threads (via SetPriority()), may be selected
from the public enumeration: Priority.
