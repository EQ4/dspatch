/// Thread class for ticking and reseting a single component

/**
A DspComponentThread is responsible for ticking and reseting a single component continuously in
a separate free-running thread. On construction, a reference to the component must be provided for
the DspThread's _Run() method to use. Once Start() has been called, the thread will begin
repeatedly executing the _Run() method. On each thread iteration, DspComponentThread simply calls
the reference component's Tick() and Reset() methods. The Pause() method causes DspComponentThread
to wait until instructed to Resume() again.
