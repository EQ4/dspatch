A DspWireBus contains DspWires (see DspWire). Each component contains an input wire bus. Via
the Tick() method, a DspComponent uses it's input wire bus to retrieve it's input signals from
incoming linked components, as mapped out in each DspWire. The DspCircuit class has an additional 2
wire buses use to connect the circuit's IO signals to and from it's internal components.
