/// Example DspComponent: Adder

/** This component has 2 inputs and 1 output. The component receives 2 floating-point buffers into
it's 2 inputs, adds each buffer element of the 1st buffer to the corresponding element of the 2nd
buffer, then stores the resultant buffer into a 3rd buffer. This resultant buffer is then passed to
output 1 of the component output bus. */
